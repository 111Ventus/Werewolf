     Ego has the ability to metamorph into others... You can pick a player at the start of the game. If that player dies, you will become what they were.
      Note: If the player was converted to HYDRA agent, you will take on their original role. All other normal rules apply: If they were The Hulk and their loved one died, you will become a Henchman. Otherwise, you will inherit their loved one.
      HYDRA cannot corrupt Ego (but can after Ego switches roles). Also - Ego can NOT win unless they have transformed. If at the end of the game, Ego is still the same, they lose (exception: lover)</value>

    <value>
      Love is in the air. As Mantis, you will choose two players to ship at the start of the game. These two players will become madly in love! If one of them dies, the other will die of sorrow :(
      Note: Lovers will know who each other are, but not be told their roles. If the lovers are the last two alive, they win, regardless of teams. If the lovers are on different teams (Avengers + Henchmen of Thanos), and one team wins (Henchmen), the lover (Avenger) wins as well. TL;DR if at least one of the lovers was on the winning team, they both win together.</value>

  <string key="AboutHunter">
    <value>
      A trigger happy, vindictive player. As Thor, you try to keep to yourself. However, when others come to visit you, they may find themselves dead, as your paranoia takes hold and you shoot bolts of lightning at them. If the Henchman attack you, you have a chance to take one of them with you. Otherwise, if you die, you will get a chance to take down someone as you die.
      Note: For Thanos Army attacks, the chance starts at 30%. If there is one Henchman, Thor has a 30% chance to kill the Henchman (and survive). For each additional Henchman, add 20% (2 Henchmen = 50%, 3 = 70%, etc). However - if there are multiple Henchmen, while you may kill one of them, you will still be outnumbered and killed.
      If HYDRA tries to corrupt you, they have a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, you have a 50% chance to kill one of them!

  <string key="AboutSK">
    <value>After being banished for years, Odin’s death has allowed you to return to your homeworld! The goddess of Death is a lone player, on their own team.

If the Henchmen try to attack you, you will kill one of them (random), and live.</value>
